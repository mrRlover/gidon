Prior to beginning any analysis in R, even before loading data, one needs to load packages that will be used to run tests and clean/transform data. Since this report is being shared with others, it would be ideal to check if a package is installed before trying to load it. We do this using an if test. The `require` function conveniently returns a logical (TRUE or FALSE) when a package loads or fails to load. We use this to test if a package exists. If it doesn't the package is installed.

```{r packages, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
packages <- c("kableExtra", "knitr", "tidyquant")

for (package in packages) {
    if (!require(package, character.only=T, quietly=T)) {
        install.packages(package, repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
    }
    library(package, character.only=T)
}
```

Next is to set global options

```{r options}
options("scipen"=99)
options("digits"=3)
```

That is it, we are all good to go from here.
